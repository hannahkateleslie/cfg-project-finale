  		<h2>about: a decade of urban climate change</h2>
  	<br>
 <p>
   Our planet is increasingly becoming more "urban". By 2050, it is predicted that 70% of the global
   population will reside in cities. We are also witnessing the unprecedented growth of megacities-
   cities with populations of greater than 10 million.
<br>
  <br>
  how do these geographical trends exacerbate our current climate emergencies and why should we care?
<br>

    <p>
      For starters, cities consume a massive amount of energy and create 70% of global CO2 emissions.
      The majority of this is contributed by large buildings, and transportation
    <br>
    <br>
      Growing urban density means that the public health effects of climate change are felt
      more strongly, by more people. In many cities, the presence of smog has already been
      estimated to shorten the average lifespan by up to a decade.
    <br>
    <br>
      A heating planet triggers natural disasters; flooding, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes.
      Urban spaces, and their complex infrastructure networks are  the most vulnerable to such events.
